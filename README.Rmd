## Introduction

This data product was using faithful data set. A linear model was built which represents the relation of eruption and waiting time. The established linear model was used predict the eruption time from user defined waiting time.

##ui.R
In ui.R, a sliderbar control was used to allow user choose a waiting time between 45 minutes to 85 minutes. the default waiting time was set as 80 minutes.
``` r
library(shiny)
shinyUI(fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Eruption Prediction"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("waiting",
                        "Waiting time (min)",
                        min = 45,
                        max = 95,
                        value = 80)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
            plotOutput("predictionPlot"),
            h3("Predicted Eruption Time(min):"),
            textOutput("pred")
        )
    )
))
```
##server.R
``` r

library(shiny)
shinyServer(function(input, output) {

    data(faithful); set.seed(333)
    #A linear model was constructed by the fucnton "lm"
    lm1 <- lm(eruptions ~ waiting,data=faithful)


    output$predictionPlot <- renderPlot({
        
        #Plotting the raw data and regression line
        
        plot(faithful$waiting,faithful$eruptions,pch=19,col="blue",xlab="Waiting",ylab="Duration")
        abline(lm1, col="green",lwd=4)

        # get the waiting time from the slide bar
        x<- input$waiting
        y<-coef(lm1)[1] + coef(lm1)[2]*x
        
        # draw line on the lenear regression fit line and report the predicted duration
        abline(v=x);abline(h=y)

    })

    output$pred <- renderText({
        coef(lm1)[1] + coef(lm1)[2]*input$waiting
    })
}
)
```
